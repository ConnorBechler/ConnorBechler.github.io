<a id='AboutMe'></a>

## About Me

I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics at Michigan State University, where I am a member of the [MI Diaries Project](https://mi-diaries.org).

My current research focuses on applying speech and language technology to sociolinguistics, language documentation, and corpus linguistics.

I graduated with a BA in Linguistics, Literature, and Chinese from Calvin University in 2020, and an MA in Linguistic Theory and Typology from the University of Kentucky in 2023.

<a id='Tools'></a>

## Software/Tools

[The MI Diaries Research Framework](https://github.com/midiaries/datahub): I did not create this, but I bug-tested and documented a portion of it. An excellent suite of tools for creating, navigating, and annotating audio corpora. 

[DiSpeechEval](https://github.com/ConnorBechler/dispeecheval): A python tool I am developing for the quick summarization of speech quantity and quality using voice activity detection.

[wav2vec2fasr](https://github.com/ConnorBechler/wav2vec2fasr-repo): A collection of resources and python interface I am developing for finetuning wav2vec2 models for low-resource automatic speech recognition and forced alignment.

<a id='Hobbies'></a>

## Non-Academic Interests

I greatly enjoy modern fencing, primarily epee. I have dabbled in game design. Hiking and backpacking provide me with a great deal of joy. While I am not always the fastest chef, I find cooking to be both soothing and satisfying. I enjoy both tea and coffee without particular partisanship.

I am always in the market for new books, recipes, and hiking spots! If you are feeling generous, send me your recommendations via email.
