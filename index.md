## About Me

I am a PhD student in Linguistics at Michigan State University.

My current research focuses on applying speech and language technology to sociolinguistics, language documentation, and corpus linguistics.

## Software/Tools

[The MI Diaries Research Framework](https://github.com/midiaries/datahub): I did not create this, but I bug-tested and documented a portion of it. An excellent suite of tools for creating, navigating, and annotating audio corpora. 

[DiSpeechEval](https://github.com/ConnorBechler/dispeecheval): A python tool I am developing for the quick summarization of speech quantity and quality using voice activity detection.

[wav2vec2fasr](https://github.com/ConnorBechler/wav2vec2fasr-repo): A collection of resources and python interface I am developing for finetuning wav2vec2 models for low-resource automatic speech recognition and forced alignment.
