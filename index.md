<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics at Michigan State University, where I am a member of the <a href="https://mi-diaries.org">MI Diaries Project</a>. </p>
<p>My current research focuses on applying speech and language technology to sociolinguistics, language documentation, and corpus linguistics.</p>

<p>I graduated with a BA in Linguistics, Literature, and Chinese from Calvin University in 2020, and an MA in Linguistic Theory and Typology from the University of Kentucky in 2023.</p>

<h2 id='Tools'>Software/Tools</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/midiaries/datahub">The MI Diaries Research Framework</a>: I did not create this, but I bug-tested and documented a portion of it. An excellent suite of tools for creating, navigating, and annotating audio corpora.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ConnorBechler/dispeecheval">DiSpeechEval</a>: A python tool I am developing for the quick summarization of speech quantity and quality using voice activity detection.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ConnorBechler/wav2vec2fasr-repo">wav2vec2fasr</a>: A collection of resources and python interface I am developing for finetuning wav2vec2 models for low-resource automatic speech recognition and forced alignment.</p>

<h2 id='Hobbies'>Non-Academic Interests</h2>

<p>I greatly enjoy modern fencing, primarily epee. I have dabbled in game design. Hiking and backpacking provide me with a great deal of joy. While I am not always the fastest chef, I find cooking to be both soothing and satisfying. I enjoy both tea and coffee without particular partisanship.</p>

<p>I am always in the market for new books, recipes, and hiking spots! If you are feeling generous, send me your recommendations via email.</p>
