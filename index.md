## Software/Tools

[dispeecheval](https://github.com/ConnorBechler/dispeecheval): tool for quick summarization of speech quantity and quality using voice activity detection.

[wav2vec2fasr](https://github.com/ConnorBechler/wav2vec2fasr-repo): package for (hopefully) easier finetuning of wav2vec2 models for low-resource automatic speech recognition and forced alignment.
